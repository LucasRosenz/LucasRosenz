## Hi. I'm an Economics undergraduate student in Argentina. After having used some software tools related to practical work in economics, I began to become very interested in Computer science. I want to learn about it as I finish my degree, and I think the best way to do that is to learn more deeply software and languages that I already use in my degree.
